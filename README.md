E-Commerce-Database-Website

Description:
- A capstone project as part of my BSC at Eduvos, where I had to develop a functional e-commerce website that pulled product and customer information from an SQL database. The website was to be built from the ground up using no existing frameworks or web-building platforms.

What I Learned:
- Thorough planning and client requirements gathering is needed to develop a website that meets expectations.
- To structure websites using HTML and apply styling using CSS.
- Implement layered security checks and input validations.
- Runtime Optimisation techniques 

Notes:
- While this project remains incomplete, I did thoroughly enjoy the experience and if it were not for the time constraints, I would have gladly developed further iterations with additional features.
